        Explicit is better than implicit\nSimple is better than complex\n
        Complex is better than complicated\nFlat is better than nested\n
        Sparse is better tahn dense\nReadability counts\nSpecial cases aren't           special enough to break the rules\nAlthough practicality beats purity.\n
        Errors should never pass silently\n Unless explicitly silence\n
        In the face of ambiguity, refuse the tehmptation to guess\n
        There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it\n
        Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch\n
        Now is better than never\nAlthough never is often better than *right* n\        ow\nIf the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea\nIf the im        plement\ation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea\nNamespaces are         one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!\n")
